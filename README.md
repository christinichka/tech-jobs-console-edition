# LC101 Unit 2 Assignment 1 Tech Jobs (Console Edition)

This project utilizes Java ArrayList and HashMap collection types. 

My contributions to this assignment were:<br><br>
Implemented printJobs to iterate over an ArrayList of jobs and a HashMap of each job with a nested loop, then print out the job fields for each job.<br><br>
Create a method called findByValue which allows users to search for a specific term within all columns.<br><br>
Make search methods case-insensitive.<br>
